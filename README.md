I'm a SWE at Advizr, where I own and build (primarily AI) products for businesses, end-end.

### A few things I have shipped:
- Production-grade RAG pipeline for a real-estate company with evals, documentation, and logging on a local VM. 
- Web scraper for Jane App booking urls to prepare a 10000+ clinic dataset for a clinic booking service.

When I'm not coding, you can catch me playing volleyball, table tennis, or pumping iron at the gym :)   
- Goal -> Bench 225lbs (current 170lbs - up 50 lbs from September 2025)

Interested? Here's more about me.
