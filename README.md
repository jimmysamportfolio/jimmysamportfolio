Currently a SWE at Advizr, where I build products for businesses, end-end.

A few things I have done at my job:
- Fully shipped a production-grade RAG pipeline for a real-estate company with evals, documentation, and logging on a local VM. 
- Fully shipped and deployed a web scraper that scrapes Jane App booking urls to prepare 10000+ clinic datasets for a clinic booking service
