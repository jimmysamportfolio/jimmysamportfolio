I'm a second-year student at UBC, studying **Business and Computer Science (BUCS)**. I finished up a summer as a technical operations specialist at Pit Stop Portables, where I optimized our technical operations using new technologies. I'm interested in product management, AI, startups and embedded systems.

I hope to eventually build my own tech startup that is accepted by YC.
