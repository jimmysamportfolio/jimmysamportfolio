I'm a second-year student at UBC, studying **Business and Computer Science (BUCS)**. I finished up a summer as a technical operations specialist at Pit Stop Portables, where I optimized our technical operations by creating some custom scripts & leveraging tools like n8n to automate highly manual processes. I'm heavily interested in product management, AI & startups. I hope to eventually build my own tech startup that is accepted by YC.

I am currently a partnerships director with UBC BizTech, the largest tech club at UBC. I am working on a startup-focused event called KickStart, where our goal is to bring together the most ambitious minds in Vancouver and force them to launch their startup ideas.
