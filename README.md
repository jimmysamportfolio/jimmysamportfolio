Currently a SWE @ Advizr, where I ship agentic AI and RAG products to small businesses.

### A few things I have built at Advizr:
- 👾 custom RAG pipeline, comparison tool and document generator for a real estate company
- 📊 automated parallel data scraper and normalizer for 10,000+ clinics across Canada

Also a Partnerships Director @ UBC BizTech (800+ members).

### A few things I am proud of during my year at BizTech:
- 📽️ got us a live interview on Global News 
- 💰 secured over $10k in sponsorships/grants 
- 🫡 led our partnerships team for Kickstart, a startup event with 40+ partners (including an a16z partner & some YC founders)

Interested in startups, agentic AI, and sports (volleyball, table tennis and soccer are my main three). Always down for a cheeky game.
